# Contributing to the Open Source Submission Process

Issues in this repo are used to track actual open source project submission processes,
and not issues with the process itself. The best way to have a discussion about the
process is to head over to the [discuss repo](https://git.corp.adobe.com/OpenSourceAdvisoryBoard/discuss).
The README explains how to raise an issue, have a conversation about the process and
create a proposal.
