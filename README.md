# Open Source Submission Process

This repo is the place to track approvals for open sourcing projects at Adobe.
It is intended to track new open source projects as well as contributions to
existing non-Adobe open source projects.

We moved the process from the Wiki to git.corp to keep a record of the projects
more efficiently and remove barriers and areas of friction in the process over
time.

## How to Use This Repo

The [issue tracker](https://git.corp.adobe.com/OpenSourceAdvisoryBoard/opensource_submission_process/issues)
is used to keep track of submissions and the approval process for each.

To submit a new request for approval, use our
[Open Source Submission Form](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/OpenSourceAdvisoryBoard/opensource_submission)!

After you submit the above form, you will be redirected to a generated issue in
this repo. The Open Source Office will work with you in that issue to help open
source your project!

We are always here to help. Please contact us by emailing [Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com)
or on Slack at #guild-opensource.

## How Approvals Work

Please take a look at our [approval process document](APPROVING.md) for more
details on how the Open Source Office goes through the approval process and
what we look out for.

## Contribution Guidelines

Feedback on the process is welcomed! Check out our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details.
